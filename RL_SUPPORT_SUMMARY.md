CausalTorch Reinforcement Learning Support Summary
=================================================

‚úÖ YES, CausalTorch fully supports reinforcement learning with episodic memory!

üéØ ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:
"Does the library support reinforcement learning and give the model a memory episodes to remember actions etc.?"

‚úÖ REINFORCEMENT LEARNING SUPPORT: YES
‚úÖ EPISODIC MEMORY FOR ACTIONS: YES
‚úÖ REMEMBERING ACTION OUTCOMES: YES
‚úÖ CAUSAL PRIORITIZATION: YES

üß† EPISODIC MEMORY FEATURES:
‚Ä¢ Action-outcome episode storage
‚Ä¢ Causal strength computation for experiences
‚Ä¢ Prioritized experience replay based on causal significance
‚Ä¢ Memory consolidation to preserve important episodes
‚Ä¢ Retrieval of high-causal episodes for learning

ü§ñ SUPPORTED RL ALGORITHMS:
‚Ä¢ Deep Q-Network (DQN)
‚Ä¢ Policy Gradient Methods
‚Ä¢ Actor-Critic (A2C)
‚Ä¢ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

üî¨ CAUSAL RL CAPABILITIES:
‚Ä¢ Causal intervention analysis in RL
‚Ä¢ Action-reward causal relationship learning
‚Ä¢ Counterfactual policy evaluation
‚Ä¢ Causal strength-based experience prioritization
‚Ä¢ Intervention tracking for better policy understanding

üìä MEMORY SYSTEM FEATURES:
‚Ä¢ Episodic Memory with configurable capacity
‚Ä¢ Causal prioritized sampling (focuses on important experiences)
‚Ä¢ Memory consolidation (removes less causal experiences)
‚Ä¢ Experience replay with causal weighting
‚Ä¢ Long-term memory through causal significance

üéÆ PRACTICAL USAGE:
```python
from causaltorch.core_architecture import FromScratchModelBuilder

# Create RL agent with episodic memory
rl_config = {
    'causal_config': {
        'hidden_dim': 128,
        'causal_rules': [
            {'cause': 'action', 'effect': 'reward', 'strength': 0.9}
        ]
    }
}

builder = FromScratchModelBuilder(rl_config)
agent = builder.build_model(
    'reinforcement_learning',
    state_dim=8,
    action_dim=4,
    agent_type='dqn',           # or 'policy_gradient', 'actor_critic', 'ppo'
    memory_capacity=10000,      # Episodic memory capacity
    batch_size=32
)

# Agent automatically remembers actions and outcomes
state = torch.randn(1, 8)
action = agent.select_action(state)
reward = 10.0
next_state = torch.randn(1, 8)
done = False

# Store experience (causal strength computed automatically)
agent.store_experience(state, action, reward, next_state, done)

# Learning uses causal prioritization
loss_info = agent.learn()  # Uses causally important experiences

# Memory analysis
causal_analysis = agent.get_causal_analysis()
high_causal_episodes = agent.episodic_memory.get_causal_episodes(min_strength=0.7)
```

üí´ DEMONSTRATED CAPABILITIES:
‚úÖ Episodic memory with 1000+ experience capacity
‚úÖ Causal prioritized experience sampling  
‚úÖ Memory consolidation preserving important episodes
‚úÖ Multiple RL algorithms (DQN, PG, A2C, PPO)
‚úÖ Complete training cycles with causal analysis
‚úÖ Intervention tracking for policy analysis
‚úÖ Action-outcome causal relationship learning

üèÜ SUMMARY:
CausalTorch provides state-of-the-art reinforcement learning capabilities with sophisticated episodic memory that goes beyond traditional experience replay. The memory system:

1. üß† REMEMBERS ACTIONS: Stores every action taken and its outcome
2. üéØ PRIORITIZES CAUSAL EXPERIENCES: Focuses learning on causally significant episodes
3. üíæ CONSOLIDATES MEMORY: Preserves important experiences long-term
4. üî¨ ANALYZES CAUSALITY: Understands which actions causally lead to rewards
5. üöÄ IMPROVES LEARNING: Uses causal insights for better policy optimization

The episodic memory system ensures that agents don't just remember random experiences, but prioritize and learn from the most causally meaningful action-outcome relationships, leading to more efficient and interpretable reinforcement learning.
